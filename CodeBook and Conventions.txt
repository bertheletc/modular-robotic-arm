Data recording convention

All data that is recorded and read by the arm are in .csv format. Rows in the file are comma 
delimited, and represent a single arm state. Meaning, each row contains as many elements as
there are linkages in the arm with 1 exception explained below. Each element is the encoder
reading of the target position, and the element's index indicates the corresponding linkage's
position on the arm (first element = bottom linkage)

The one exception to when the number of rows = number of elements is on `waits', i.e. when the
arm is told to wait at a position for some time. This will be marked by having the first
element be the keyword "WAIT" followed by exactly one more element in that row (row is of size
two exactly). The second element indicates the amount of time to wait in milliseconds.
